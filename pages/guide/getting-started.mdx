# Getting Started with OmegaONE

OmegaONE was designed in a way, that setting it up and developing apps using it would be a piece of cake.
Given that Omega is a purely javascript framework, there are no need of compilers or any other transformers
for Omega.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'
 
<Callout type='info'>
    OmegaONE itself don't need a compiler to transform it to pure javascript, but if you are using libraries
    like SCSS, then you'd need a compiler specific to that. 
</Callout>

## Installing OmegaONE

### 1. Modular CDN

Installing OmegaONE is a piece of cake. You can directly use it in your HTML using our **unique** modular import
cdn.

```html {10-16} copy
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Hello Omega</title>
  </head>
  <body>

    <script type="importmap">
      {
        "imports": {
          "@indivice/omega/": "https://indivice.github.io/omega/dist/"
        }
      }
    </script>

    <div id="app"></div>
    <script type="module">
      import { Render } from '@indivice/omega/index.js';
      import { Layout } from '@indivice/omega/components.js';

      Render({
        selector: '#app',
        app: () => 
            Layout.Column({
                child: "Hello World"
            })
      })

    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### 2. Using Vite

Vite is a popular scaffolding tool to build production applications. You can use OmegaONE with Vite using the vanilla settings.
OmegaONE is compatible with both **javascript** and **typescript**

```bash copy
$ cd my-vite-project
my-vite-project~$ npm i @indivice/omega
```

### 3. Using Templates

OmegaONE has for now, two basic templates that you can use directly without the hassle of setting things up. We are working on
a CLI tool that would help you to customize your templates and tools. All the templates uses **Vite** under the hood.

#### Javascript Template

```bash copy
$ npx degit https://github.com/indivice/omega/template/js my-project
$ cd my-project
my-project~$ npm i
```

#### Typescript Template

```bash copy
$ npx degit https://github.com/indivice/omega/template/ts my-project
$ cd my-project
my-project~$ npm i
```
## Next steps

This section is more like tutorial; it goes through maximum features in a order where learning is easier; I
try to keep the articles very simple, and small to help understand small chunks of concepts.

The upcoming articles in this guide section assumes that you have created your project using **Vite**. Though, after
completing this guide, you can implement the core knowledge to anywhere Omega runs.
