# Dynamic Layouts in OmegaONE

So far, we learned about building simple and static layouts, but that is not enough to make real applications,
since real applications is reactive; it listens to changes, and is capable of updating the interface based
on some background activity or user interaction.

We will build up our concepts by first understanding the reactive primitives, and best practices around
reactive layouts.

## Application State

Application state can be thought of a value, that describes the state of certain part of user-interface. For example,
I can think of a game, whose **score** is a state, that might change based on how the player is performing.
There are several parts of UI that change, which ultimately depends upon some external variable or factor.

We can implement such a state in Omega, using the `State` class.

```ts {1, 4} copy filename="src/service/counter.service.ts"
import { State } from '@indivice/omega'

//creates a state with 0 initial value
const counter = new State(0)
export counter
```

This counter, can now be used anywhere in your application, and changing the value of the counter, will change
it everywhere the value is being consumed.

It is not necessary to define a state in a service. Infact, states can be created and exported anywhere, as long
as the state names are not conflicted.

## State operators

Now that we have defined our state, we need a way to work with it. Since a state is a class, you will have object
methods, and static methods that helps in various operations

### 1. Reading and Writing

We can read the **current** value of a state, using the `.get()` method, and we can set a new value of the state
using the `.set()` method.

The reason why we do not directly mutate the values, is because there are additional functionality than just setting
the value that runs in the background, which actually makes the state reactive.

Let us see a simple example using the `counter` state we defined previously.

```ts {1} copy filename="src/main.ts"
import { counter } from './service/counter.service'

//we will get 0 initially
console.log(
    counter.get()
)

counter.set(1)

//we will now get 1
console.log(
    counter.get()
)
```
Another method that changes the value of the state is '.update()' method. The `.update()` method works differently
because it takes a callback, that must return the value we intend on setting, and it also gives you the current
value as the callback argument.

Let us see an example of why it is useful:

```ts {1, 5} copy filename="src/main.ts"
import { counter } from './service/counter.service'

setInterval(() => {

    counter.set( counter.get() + 1 )
    console.log(
        counter.get()
    )

}, 1000)
```

We can see in the highlighted portion, that the counter actually needs to increment it, because we cannot make assumptions
about the previous value. If you run this, it will simply logs number counting from 0 every 1 second.

While this is not necessarily bad, it becomes highly complex when dealing with arrays, objects or other nested components,
which when becomes a burden to handle. We can write a cleaner version using `.update()` method:

```ts {1, 5} copy filename="src/main.ts"
import { counter } from './service/counter.service'

setInterval(() => {

    counter.update( prev => prev + 1 )
    console.log(
        counter.get()
    )

}, 1000)
```

### 2. Subscription and Batching

Now that we are capable of creating a state, changing it's value, or updating it, we might also need to
listen to changes too, and the type of change that happened.

All reactivity in Omega is actually implemented on top of the **Subscription** method, since reactivity means
change detection, and reactive layouts will need to know when the state is changing.

We can listen to changes using the `.listen()` method. A callback is provided to that method, and whenever the
state is changed, all the callbacks that are subscribed to that state are called one by one.

Let us re-implement our counter using this:

```ts {3-5} copy filename="src/main.ts"
import { counter } from './service/counter.service'

counter.listen(() => {
    console.log(counter.get())
})

setInterval(() => {
    counter.update( prev => prev + 1 )
}, 1000)
```

This will have the same effect as manually loggin it, but it is more powerful, because if the state were
to update from anywhere else, this callback will still be executed!

The subscriber is actually a `Set`, so you can remove a subscriber if you happen to know the reference.
You can actually get the reference, since it is returned by the listen method.

```ts {6} filename="example.ts"
//example code below
const state = new State("Hello World!")
const callback = state.listen(() => console.log(state.get()))

//something happened, I want to remove the listener
state.subscribers.delete(callback)
```

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'
 
<Callout type='warning'>
While it seems very powerful that we can play around states unlike other frameworks/libraries,
but there are certain things you need to be aware of:

- Changing the value directly (which you can) will cause any of the subscribers to be **NOT** called,
hence causing a `hidden-change`, which means changes that goes un-detected.

- The `.delete()` method on the `.subscribers` member of the state can be played around too, but
be careful! because there are also other subscribers that might be listening to it! You do not want
to have unexpected behaviours, unless ofcourse you know what you are doing.
</Callout>

While all of this, we can also observe one problem, Repetion. Let me clarify by an example:

```ts copy filename="src/main.ts"
import { State } from '@indivice/omega'

const firstName = new State("Mayukh")
const lastName = new State("Chakraborty")

const callback = firstName.listen(() => {
    console.log(`Full name: ${ firstName.get() } ${ lastName.get() }`)
})

lastName.listen(callback)

firstName.set("David")
lastName.set("Jones")
```

The issue here is, when I am concurrently updating two states (i.e one after another), The function
is called twice. 

Though this will not take a toll on your performance, but imagine you had to update
a lot of states at once, all of them have a common subscriber. That subscriber will be called that
many times, and only the last call will be useful (because all updates will be finished.)

This is where the concpet of Batching comes into play.

```ts { 12-15 } copy filename="src/main.ts"
import { State } from '@indivice/omega'

const firstName = new State("Mayukh")
const lastName = new State("Chakraborty")

const callback = firstName.listen(() => {
    console.log(`Full name: ${ firstName.get() } ${ lastName.get() }`)
})

lastName.listen(callback)

State.batch( //static function to batch update
    firstName.set("David", true) //set batching to true
    lastName.set("Jones", true) //sets batching to true
)
```
Now you'd see that the callback is called once, after all the values are updated.
 
<Callout type='info'>
Make sure you are listening to the same functions while batching!
</Callout>

## Hook functions

Hooks in omega are just simple functions that starts with the prefix `use`. Hooks can be used
anywhere, and can operate on anything.

Hooks in omega are simply helper functions that helps the developer to abstract away messy code
that would otherwise affect readibilty, with no effect on performance, rather hooks might even improve
performance by doing things the right way.

There are several built-in hooks in omega that looks after different aspects of your app, and we will
look into them one by one.

### The `useMemo()` Hook

The `useMemo()` hook helps us to derive values from other states, and then tracks the changes of the
said states. When any one of the state changes, the callback passed into the hook is called to re-build
the new value.
