# Building Layouts in OmegaONE

The main reason why UI libraries like Omega exists, is to make the process of constructing user-interfaces easier.
This is done, by creating a structure, called Layouts.

We can build Layouts in OmegaJS using **Components**, which are isolated and re-usable code logic that helps to
render some content on the browser.

In this article, we will discuss how we can make static layouts, covering several aspects of building UI, best practices,
recommendations, and design principles.

## Components in OmegaONE

Components in the context of web development space, means isolated logic that when changed, is changed
globally, requiring less efforts when updating certain parts of the interface.

In OmegaONE, Layouts are made by composing these components. You can either create your own components from
scratch, or directly use the built-ins.

## Creating a Component

Let us create a simple hello world component

```ts copy filename="src/main.ts"
import { Render } from '@indivice/omega'
import { Layout } from '@indivice/omega/compoonents'

function HelloWorld() {

    return Layout.Column({
        child: "Hello World"
    })
    
}

Render({
    selector: "#app",
    app: HelloWorld
})
```
The `HelloWorld()` function is our component, which is returning a `Layout.Column({})` Component, which is
one of the built-ins of OmegaONE. Almost every built-in component takes a child, or an array of children, except for few like `Content.BreakLine({})` because
it does not require children.

The `Render({})` function here takes your component structure, calls it internally, and puts in on the DOM that the user finally
interacts with. In any application, the `Render` function is only called once, and it is provided with the root Component, from
which every other component starts.

## Accepting children

One best thing about OmegaONE is that, the components are pure javascript function, and by that, I mean anything that is
possible using pure javascript, is possible with OmegaONE too.

You can accept children in your own custom component, or any other property, however you might see fit. For example, I can
create a custom greeting message instead of `"Hello World"`

```ts { 4, 7, 14 } copy filename="src/main.ts"
import { Render } from '@indivice/omega'
import { Layout } from '@indivice/omega/compoonents'

function HelloWorld(greeting: string) {

    return Layout.Column({
        child: greeting
    })
    
}

Render({
    selector: "#app",
    app: () => HelloWorld("Welcome, Mayukh")
})
```
Now, instead of showing `"Hello World"`, it will show `"Welcome, Mayukh"`. Though it will not change the message
based on some user input yet; which we will learn in the reactive layouts part.

Let us now try accepting another component, say a showcase function!

```ts {1-2, 4, 7-10, 17} copy filename="src/main.ts"
import { Render, Component } from '@indivice/omega'
import { Layout, Input } from '@indivice/omega/compoonents'

function ShowCase(name: string, component: Component) {

    return Layout.Column({
        children: [
            `This component was made by ${name}`,
            component
        ]
    })
    
}

Render({
    selector: "#app",
    app: () => ShowCase("Mayukh", Input.Button({ child: "I am a button!" }))
})
```
This will show the name of the person that made the component, as well as the component itself.

## Styling our Component

There are various methods of styling based on how you are using OmegaONE.

### 1. Vite-Bundling

If you are using vite, you can simply create external stylesheets and import them directly!

```ts { 3, 8 } copy filename="main.ts" filename="src/main.ts"
import { Render, Component } from '@indivice/omega'
import { Layout, Input } from '@indivice/omega/compoonents'
import './style.css'

function ShowCase(name: string, component: Component) {

    return Layout.Column({
        id: "color-id", /*Or we can use class*/ class: "font",
        children: [
            `This component was made by ${name}`,
            component
        ]
    })
    
}

Render({
    selector: "#app",
    app: () => ShowCase("Mayukh", Input.Button({ child: "I am a button!" }))
})
```
```css copy filename="style.css"
#color-id {
    color: "red"; /*Or any other styling of your choice*/
}

.font {
    font-family: "Manrope"
}
```

### 2. Inline Styles

We can use inline styles inside all components that supports it. If I have to be honest, all **UI** Components supports
inline styling, the rest are technically not **UI** Components, they are dynamic helpers or builders.

Just like in HTML, we can use the style property to give styles to our code!

```ts {8-10} copy filename="src/main.ts"
import { Render, Component } from '@indivice/omega'
import { Layout, Input } from '@indivice/omega/compoonents'

function ShowCase(name: string, component: Component) {

    return Layout.Column({

        style: {
            color: "red"
        },

        id: "color-id",
        children: [
            `This component was made by ${name}`,
            component
        ]
    })
    
}

Render({
    selector: "#app",
    app: () => ShowCase("Mayukh", Input.Button({ child: "I am a button!" }))
})
```
The names of the styling in the inline format is a bit different. For example, `background-color` for normal
css would be `backgroundColor` in the inline format, and this applies for all dash-separated style name in css.

## Listening to Events

One of the most important aspects of building web applications, is to listen to events. This is because, interfaces
works on the basis of interaction, and events are the foundation of this component-interatction model. All interactions
from a component is driven through events.

In omega, we prefix a lowercase `on` before all events. For example, `onclick`, or `oninput`, and this applies for all
the available events in HTML. [Click to see list of all UI events.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/UI_Events)

```ts { 8-10 } copy filename="src/main.ts"
import { Render, Component } from '@indivice/omega'
import { Layout, Input } from '@indivice/omega/compoonents'

function ShowCase(name: string, component: Component) {

    return Layout.Column({

        onclick() {
            alert("I was clicked!")
        },

        style: {
            color: "red"
        },

        id: "color-id",
        children: [
            `This component was made by ${name}`,
            component
        ]
    })
    
}

Render({
    selector: "#app",
    app: () => ShowCase("Mayukh", Input.Button({ child: "I am a button!" }))
})
```

## Library specific properties

There are properties other than the ones provided by HTML. Here is the list of all the
custom properties for all components:

- `reference` -> Takes in a `State<HTMLElement>` and stores the current real-dom element in it. 
Can be used to directly refer to a real dom element.

- `ondestroy` -> Is a library specific event that triggers when the specific component is removed from the
DOM.

- `__driver__` -> Is a metadata-based property, which is used by Omega's driver, and are useful for developing
custom components and custom renderers.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'
 
<Callout type='info'>
    We will learn more about `reference` property in the **Reactive Layouts** article.
</Callout>

## Other Native components

Aside from the pre-existing components we just saw, there are other useful components, that are technically not
available in the web platform, but are implemented by Omega to make it more useful.

- `Layout.Portal()`: Helps in creating component outside the component tree. This component is useful when
showing overlays like modals or alerts, that needs to be at the top of every other components. The component
will be outside a component, but can still use the logic of that component

- `Layout.HTML()`: Helps in creating pure-html based content, that can also be dynamically updated. It takes
either a raw string, or a dynamic callback function.

We will learn all of them in our upcoming article **Reactive Layouts**

## Next Steps

In this article, we learned to create simple layouts, but real applications are almost always dynamic, and
needs UI changing based on user interactions, which is very much lacking here.

We will learn everything about reactive layouts in the next article, and build upon it, and making progress
towards building a real application.
