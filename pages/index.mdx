# Welcome to OmegaONE!
 
I am glad to see you here! I have written this documentation, keeping in my mind, that several developers,
experienced and novice, will come here to seek knowledge. OmegaJS, a project that I started to see how far
I can push the limits of web, got it's first major version, **OmegaONE**.

To be able to take full advantage of this documentation, I expect my readers to know about the following:

- Javascript and Typescript
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Document Object Model
- Basics of HTML & CSS

I hope you have a great time learning OmegaONE, and a greater time building apps with it.
